        <h2>Review book To all the boys i've loved before</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Follows a girl called Lara Jean and through her life she has written letters to all the boys she has loved in her past, she keeps these letters safely tucked away from the word. However, one day she finds they are gone, her letters have been sent out, and everyone she has ever loved now knows. Including her older sisters ex-boyfriend. This story follows Lara Jean as she struggles with her relationship with her older sister and her past loves.

                It had so many levels, yes it was a "love story" but it also focused on the relationship between sisters and family. I really really enjoyed this, and when I read the last page I actually got angry because I wanted more. I really hope this is a series.

        <h2>Review movie To all the boys i've loved before </h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Having thoroughly enjoyed the book and it's characters, my expectations for the film were somewhat high - and met!
                The film is a light hearted and fun watch, not dissimilar to films like The DUFF and How to be Single. I was left feeling sentimental and warm, I'll be watching it again later today!
                The adaptation was true to the book and contained the key elements that made it such a fun read in the first place. Lara Jean is as fickle but entertaining as her character in the book, the same with other characters (Peter is just as cocky but charming). My only slight complaint is that we didn't get to see the best of Kitty, the craziest and wittiest character in the book at such a young age! She had some fantastic one liners in the books that still make me cackle.
                The ending of the film set it up well for the sequel - hopefully other fans enjoy it as much as I did and we get to see everyone reunite to tackle the next plot!
