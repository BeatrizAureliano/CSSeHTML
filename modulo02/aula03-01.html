        <p>Deixo os meus destaques como resenha
            CHAPTER 1 PLAYING PILGRIMS
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 85
            It’s bad enough to be a girl , anyway , when I like boy’s games and work and manners ! I can’t get over my disappointment in not being a boy .
            CHAPTER 8 JO MEETS APOLLYON
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 1314
            am angry nearly every day of my life , Jo , but I have learned not to show it , and I still hope to learn not to feel it , though it may take me another forty years to do so . ”
            CHAPTER 9 MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 1624
            Money is a needful and precious thing , and when well used , a noble thing , but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for . I’d rather see you poor men’s wives , if you were happy , beloved , contented , than queens on thrones , without self - respect and peace . ”
            CHAPTER 35 HEARTACHE
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6029
            “ I can’t say ‘ yes ’ truly , so I won’t say it at all .
            Nota - Posição 6029
            One for the money, two for the show; I never was ready so I watched you go.

            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6186
            I’m not like the rest of you . I never made any plans about what I’d do when I grew up . I never thought of being married , as you all did . I couldn’t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth , trotting about at home , of no use anywhere but there .
            CHAPTER 39 LAZY LAURENCE
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6596
            Amy never would pet him like the others , but she was very glad to see him now , and quite clung to him , feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess .
            Destaque (rosa) - Posição 6681
            “ That’s just why , because talent isn’t genius , and no amount of energy can make it so . I want to be great , or nothing . I won’t be a common - place dauber , so I don’t intend to try any more . ”
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6715
            “ Well , I despise you . ”
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6717
            “ Why , if you please ? ” “ Because , with every chance for being good , useful , and happy , you are faulty , lazy , and miserable . ”
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 6720

            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 7206
            am lonely , and perhaps if Teddy had tried again , I might have said ‘ Yes , ’ not because I love him any more , but because I care more to be loved than when he went away . ”
            CHAPTER 43 SURPRISES
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 7243
            “ An old maid , that’s what I’m to be . A literary spinster , with a pen for a spouse , a family of stories for children , and twenty years hence a morsel of fame , perhaps , when , like poor Johnson , I’m old and can’t enjoy it , solitary , and can’t share it , independent , and don’t need it . Well , I needn’t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner , and , I dare say , old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it , but . . . ”
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 7250
            Don’t laugh at the spinsters , dear girls , for often very tender , tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns , and many silent sacrifices of youth , health , ambition , love itself , make the faded faces beautiful in God’s sight .
            Destaque (amarelo) - Posição 7281
            “ What does Amy call you ? ” “ My lord . ”
            Destaque (azul) - Posição 7320
            Amy and you changed places in my heart , that’s all .
            Destaque (laranja) - Posição 7327
            but , Teddy , we never can be boy and girl again . The happy old times can’t come back , and we mustn’t expect it . We are man and woman now , with sober work to do , for playtime is over , and we must give up frolicking . I’m sure you feel this . I see the change in you , and you’ll find it in me . I shall miss my boy , but I shall love the man as much , and admire him more , because he means to be what I hoped he would . We can’t be little playmates any longer , but we will be brother and sister , to love and help one another all our lives , won’t we , Laurie ? ”
